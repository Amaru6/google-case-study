This table contains the raw data necessary to perform the calculations it was
collected in 2019 by the Ministry of Education. This nationwide iniciative 
that took place across Peru is considered an "effective planning tool", and for the
purposes of this analysis it will also be "an effective case study".
The exam in 2019 consisted of three main areas of knowledge: reading,
mathematics and natural science each one with their own baseline values.

** ISE (índice socioeconómico)

1. Content: It is the result of a principal component analysis on the following 4 
variables per each student: (1) parents' years of study; (2) building materials of
the house in which the student lives; (3) basic services available in the house;
(4) other services available in their house.

2. Validity: We are getting closer to the intended variable (a latent
variable which measure economic factors) per each student by capturing
all information in those 4 variables. In addition to that, as we aggregate
the results from per student to per district information is lost, so that is one
of the assumptions of the present study.
