## As expected No government schools perform better than no governmental ones
## That doesn't mean that they are "better" or are causing a greater
## test score since the kids who go there probably have other conditions
## they can enjoy that makes them better at school. These are call
## confounders. One of them is the "economic conditions of the family". We 
## can use regression to hold that variable constant

### We get that schools with no governmental administration and holding
### constant the economic indicators aggregated per district perform
### better than governmental ones. Of course, this is a raw estimate
### serious problems occurs because each school have a couple of
### confounders that we wish to control for such as the quality of books,
### teachers, etc. A proxy solution would be to use panel data.
### But we don't have that here.
